Client Interfaces
=================

MapD uses `Apache Thrift <https://thrift.apache.org>`__ to generate
client-side interfaces. The *interface definitions* are in
``$MAPD_PATH/mapd.thrift``. See Apache Thrift documentation on how to
generate client-side interfaces for different programming languages with
Thrift. Also see ``$MAPD_PATH/samples`` for sample client code.
