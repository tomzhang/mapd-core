MapD documentation, written in reStructured Text and compiled by Sphinx.

RST primers:

    http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html
    http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html
    http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html

Requires pip, virtualenv, and pdflatex. Instructions for installing these
dependencies are below.

Raw documentation resides in .rst files under a directory named for each guide.
Currently:

    immerse-user-guide/
    mapd-guide/

To add a new section, list it in the `index.rst` for the relevant guide.

To view changes, rebuild the documentation with:

    ./build.sh

HTML will be in `build/dirhtml`. Individual PDFs will be in `build/latex`.

If doing a full mapd build managed by CMake, you can instead do:

    make docs

and view them in `$CMAKE_BUILD_DIR/docs/`.

You may wish to run a web server so that your browser correctly loads
`index.html` when visiting a new directory. Run one of the following and then
visit http://localhost:8282 :

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8282
    python3 -m http.server 8282

Images should be selected with care: remember that PDFs are expected to be
static, possibly printed, documents. Therefore if adding a .gif, also provide a
static version of it as a .jpg. In your document refer to these images with
`base.*` instead of `base.gif`, and the Sphinx will select an acceptable file
type for PDF and HTML. Note: for historical reasons .png trumps all. This is
why you must provide a .jpg to replace a .gif instead of a .png.

HTML/CSS theme files are in `_themes/mapd_docs_theme`.
